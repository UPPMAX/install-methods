============

<http://www.htslib.org/doc/bcftools.html>

Used under license:
MIT/Expat or GPL v3

Structure creating script (makeroom_bcftools_1.9.sh) made with makeroom.sh (Author: Jonas SÃ¶derberg) and moved to /sw/bioinfo/bcftools/makeroom_1.9.sh


Holds the bcf/vcf commands which were in the old htslib. Associated with samtools and htslib.
<http://www.htslib.org/download/>


Simple installation with system version tools. Could be redone with newer compiler.
Note that the GSL option was not added due to complicated issues on Milou (related to ATLAS).
May try again later, if needed.
