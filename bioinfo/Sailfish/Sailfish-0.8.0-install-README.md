Quantifying abundances of transcripts from RNA-Seq data.

I installed from source, using the cmake build mechanism, but I did not save
the command history.  Certainly I used cmake with a prefix etc.  Like the tool
Salmon, this one builds libraries that it seeks in the relative directory
`../lib/` so this must be installed next to `bin/`.
