Structure creating script (makeroom_vep_99.sh) made with makeroom.sh (Author: Jonas SÃ¶derberg) and moved to /sw/bioinfo/vep/makeroom_99.sh

makeroom.sh invoked with:
/home/jonass/uppmax/install-methods/makeroom.sh -t "vep" -v "99" -w "https://github.com/Ensembl/ensembl-vep" -d "Variant Effect Predictor predicts the functional effects of genomic variants." -l "Apache 2.0" -f"

    ./INSTALL.pl -d $PFX -t -c $CACHEDIR

NOTE: running the INSTALL.pl script will generate a question:

    Have you
    1. added /sw/apps/bioinfo/vep/87/milou to your PERL5LIB environment variable?
    2. added /sw/apps/bioinfo/vep/87/milou/htslib to your PATH environment variable?
    (y/n)

The two `export` lines above do that, so answer `y`.

I did not follow the next instruction:
##If on rackham, answer `n` to all cache installation questions.

Copy over the scripts.  This copies over the whole git tree, which is fine.  It
then removes the large test subdirectory.  Ensure all can find the proper perl
via `#!/usr/bin/env perl` line to  and (unlike earlier VEP versions) do not
deactiveate the install script so users can install their own to their own
project directories.
