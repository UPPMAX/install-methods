There are prebuilt executables under `data/` but they want a `libdat.so` which
we don't have.  Rebuild.  Needs to be compiled with an older gcc.  I'm sure a
newer one would work with the right flags but `gcc/5.3.0` has `openmpi/1.10.1`
associated with it and works fine without any `Makefile` modifications.

    module load gcc/5.3.0
    module load openmpi/1.10.1
    cd sources/
    make clean
    make

The build process installs into `../data/`.

    cd ../data
    cp -av * $PFX/
    cd ../sources
    make clean
