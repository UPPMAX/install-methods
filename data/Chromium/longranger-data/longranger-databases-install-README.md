Chromium longranger databases
=============================

The databases are versioned separately from the longranger tool.  Previously,
we were matching database and tool versions, and symlinks have been left in
place for those that follow that.  But, there are only two versions: 2.0.0,
which contains a single genome, and 2.1.0, which contains all data released by
Chromium for longranger.


See the other doc file for how 2.1.0 was installed.
