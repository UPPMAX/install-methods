Run the installer called Mathematica_11.2.0_LINUX.sh. This is a bash script with a .tar appended to it, and will install the program. It will ask for a target directory for the install and the binaries.

It is up to each user to provide activation/license information.
Teresa Kupsc has some licenses for the physics department (in February 2018).

No sense in making a Bianca version because of the network license.
