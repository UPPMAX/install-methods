Beginning with R 3.3.0, several libraries have been removed from R's source
tree.  I had to build and install modules for `xz/5.2.2` and `pcre/8.38`,
tintin shared libraries for `bzip2/1.0.6`, and fix several shared library
symlink versioning problems; for example, `./configure` was not recognising the
presence of `bzip2/1.0.6` because it was missing a simlink `libbz2.so.1 ->
libbz2.so.1.0`.  There were others.  The major clue I was able to use to track
down these missing version symlinks was by building an example program built
based on the test program contents shown in `config.log` at a point of failure.
If `ldd` on that program didn't show me that it was getting the shared library
from the module location, then it was probably looking for a versioned
name/symlink that didn't exist.

    module load libcurl/7.45.0
    module load zlib/1.2.8
    module load bzip2/1.0.6
    module load xz/5.2.2
    module load pcre/8.38
    module load gcc/6.2.0
    module load java/sun_jdk1.8.0_92

    ./configure --prefix=$PFX --with-libpng --with-jpeglib --with-cairo --enable-R-shlib --with-readline=yes

Make sure the configure finds libcurl and the others. Don't worry, it will
complain if it doesn't.

### Special for rackham, bianca, irma

For rackham, bianca and irma, the system versions of most of these libraries
are recent enough to be used directly.  The only modules that need to be loaded
are `gcc/6.2.0` and `java/sun_jdk1.8.0_92`.  Check the `/sw/apps/R/mf/`
directory for what is being loaded differently on milou (the default) and
rackham for version 3.3.2 to make sure.

### continuing ...

    make -j 8
    make check
    make install

As for python, we prevent inadvertent package installations in the module tree
by members of group `sw` with:

    chmod -R -w /sw/apps/R/x86_64/$VERSION/$CLUSTER
