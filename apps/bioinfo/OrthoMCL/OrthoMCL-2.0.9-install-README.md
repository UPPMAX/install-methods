OrthoMCL-2.0.9-install-README.md
================================

OrthoMCL is originally built on MySQL.  Sofia Robb at the Stajich lab created a SQLite fork:

<https://github.com/stajichlab/OrthoMCL>

We have an UPPMAX-specific fork of this fork:

<https://github.com/douglasgscofield/OrthoMCL>

that includes a wrapper script `orthomcl_wrapper_UPPMAX` specific for UPPMAX.

Because it is built on Perl scripts, of the trouble in getting OrthoMCL to work
is in getting its prerequisites in place.
