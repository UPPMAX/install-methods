Centrifuge-indices databases
============================

These are indices for the Centrifuge contamination tool.

<https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/centrifuge/>

We don't build these on a schedule; only (so far) when installing the tool
itself.  They are **117GB**.

For how these are currently built, see
`Centrifuge-1.0.4-beta-install-README.md` under `apps/bioinfo/Centrifuge/`.
