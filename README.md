Module Installation Methods
===========================

This is a collection of READMEs generated during installation of software
applications on Uppmax clusters.  It is incomplete in terms of modules
available on Uppmax, and the individual READMEs may also be incomplete in terms
of what was actually done to install the modules.  We are publicising these in
the hopes that they can be helpful.

The directories contain software installations in major subject areas.
